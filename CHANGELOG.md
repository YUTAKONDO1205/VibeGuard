# Changelog

All notable changes to VibeGuard across CLI / GitHub Action / VS Code extension /
Chrome extension are documented here. Per-extension changelogs live alongside
each extension (see `extensions/vscode/CHANGELOG.md`).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **Rules**: framework-misconfig rules for Django, Flask, and Express
  (`VG-FW-001..003`).
- **Rules**: CRYPTO rules extended from JS/TS/Python to PHP, Ruby, Java, Go,
  and C# — same weak-algorithm / weak-RNG / weak-hash detections, more
  languages.
- **VS Code**: `VibeGuard: Export Findings (SARIF / JSON)` command — exports
  the workspace's accumulated findings to `.sarif` (v2.1.0) or `.json` via
  the standard save dialog.
- **Chrome**: `Scan PR diff` button on GitHub `/pull/<n>` Files-changed tabs.
  Walks the diff table, scans each touched file as a reconstructed
  pseudo-content, and filters to findings that overlap an added line.
- **Chrome**: scan history — the bottom **History** panel persists the most
  recent 50 scan results (summary + finding metadata only — never the full
  code) in `chrome.storage.local`.
- **CI**: tag-driven release workflow that packages the CLI tarball, VS Code
  VSIX, and Chrome zip and attaches them to the GitHub Release.
- **CI**: non-blocking performance benchmark job.

### Changed
- **VS Code**: extension renamed to `vibeguard-aicoding` (displayName
  `VibeGuard AICoding`) for the Marketplace listing. Marketplace icon added.

### Fixed
- **CLI**: `--ignore` is now honoured in diff scans; PR diff gate excludes
  `samples/` to mirror whole-repo self-scan.
- **Chrome**: side panel renderer no longer uses `innerHTML` (VG-INJ-006).
- **Rules**: rule definition files self-suppress (`vibeguard:disable-file`)
  so the analyzer doesn't flag its own pattern literals.

### Security
- Self-scan added a `vibeguard:disable-file` pragma to the Chrome
  diff-reconstruct test fixture (the AWS example key
  `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` was tripping VG-SEC-001 on main pushes).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

First public release.
